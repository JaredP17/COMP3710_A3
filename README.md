Improve the app developed in Assignment 2 with two new functions:

1. Store the notes when the app is closed, and re-load them when the app is open (e.g., using SharedPreferences)

2. Add a search feature with a text box for entering a keyword and a Search button. When the button is clicked, 
   display only notes containing the keyword in the text box. If the text box is empty then display all notes.
